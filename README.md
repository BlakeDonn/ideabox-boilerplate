# Ideabox Group Project

### Project Description ###

This was a group project that was designed to store and organize ideas. A use can input a title and body for the idea. The user can also delete ideas, favourite them, and filter the ideas by those favourites. The user's ideas are saved to local storage, so they persist on page refresh, assuring that the ideas recorded on the site are saved for the user. The website is responsive, and adjusts layouts to suit both desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

## Learning Goals ##

* Continue to improve on building responsive client-side applications with good user feedback.
* Understand how to implement client-side data persistence using `localStorage`.
* Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model.
* Utilize `data-*` attributes.
* Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed.
* Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP.
* Use and understand event delegation and bubbling.

## Planning ##

This group project was created using Atom as the text editor, and our project management was done through our private channel in slack. We references MDN documentation, lesson plans, CSS tricks, and notes for information. We contacted peers and mentors for support when we became stuck. Our remote repository is stored on GitHub.

We were given seven days for this project.

**Challenges**

* Following the git workflow with multiple branches and group members. This was especially challenging at times when multiple branches were open and actively being worked on at one time.
* Due to a global pandemic, the project needed to be done entirely remotely. All three members of the teams reside and did work across different time zones.
* Creating a smooth transition between mobile, tablet, and desktop view.

**Wins**

* Working on JavaScript, CSS, and HTML in a collaborative environment while working under deadlines.
* Learning how to use and manage local storage.
* Becoming used to using media queries in CSS.
* Properly implementing event delegation.
* We are proud of the code that was written, and proud of the fact that the website functions as expected up through iteration 4.

### Functionality ###

**Main Page Functionality**

* When both the title and body input fields are filled out, the Save Idea button is activated. Upon clicking the button, an idea card is generated using the values of the input field filled out by the user.

* When the 'star' is clicked on an idea card, the card is saved as a favourite. When the 'x' is clicked on an idea card, the card is deleted from the page.

* When the 'Show Starred Ideas' button is clicked, only the idea cards that have been favourited will show on the screen. The button will then change to 'Show All Ideas', and upon click, all ideas will show on the screen.

* To search through the ideas made for a specific word or phrase, use the search bar. When typing the phrase, the idea cards will be filtered accordingly.
